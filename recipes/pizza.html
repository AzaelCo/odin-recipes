    <p>This is my own writing and I wrote it and did not copy it off the internet page from allrecipes with the same title. 
        Off the top of my dome all on my own I would say "No-guilt pizza for breakfast? YES!
        Use a CAULIPOWER tm pizza for delicious and easy breakfast the whole family will love"
    </p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 CAULIPOWER tm Margherita Pizza</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>4 slices turkey bacon</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped fresh spinach</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup egg whites</li>
            <li>1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of fresh basil (NOT OPTIONAL)</li>
        </ul>


    <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place pizza on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a frying pan. Saute bacon, onion, and bell pepper in the hot oil until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain off any grease and return to the pan. Add chopped spinach and garlic; stir until spinach is wilted. Remove from the pan to a small bowl to let cool for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pizza from oven. Leave oven on. Add egg whites to vegetable mixture; stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Carefully top pizza with vegetable-egg mixture. Pour slowly so eggs don't run off the sides. Use a spoon to catch any drips and return to the top of the pizza.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Top with Cheddar cheese and bake for 5 minutes more. Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil.</li>
        </ol>
